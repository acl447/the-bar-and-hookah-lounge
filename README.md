# The Bar and Hookah Lounge

Using this app, customers can make reservations at The Bar and Hookah Lounge, a great place to unwind after a long day. Customers simply pick their preferred hookah flavor from a large selection of choices and enter their name and contact information to reserve a table. If tables are full, they will be notified that they were put on the waitlist. Customers can also click "See Our Cocktails" to see the selection of cocktails to choose from. 

By visiting the manager page at [https://sheltered-hollows-95744.herokuapp.com/manager], managers of the bar can update their stock of hookah flavors and update reservations. If a table is available, they can reserve it from the waitlist.

Technologies used to make this app are HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Express, Express-Handlebars, MySQL, The Cocktail DB API, AJAX, Heroku, and Animista.

Working with Dante Proto and Matt Pengelly, I primarily contributed to the Express-Handlebars and Bootstrap code, displaying the web pages on the front-end, but I did also create routes to allow managers to add new hookah flavors to the selection and delete flavors from the selection.
